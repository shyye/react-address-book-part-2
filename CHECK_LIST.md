## Core

- [x] 1. A user can view a dashboard that displays a list of contacts
    - Each contact in the list should be displayed as their first and last names
- [x] 2. A user can click a contact's name to view more details about that contact
    - The view should contain the contact's first and last name, as well as the contact's street and city
- [ ] 3. A user can create a contact via a form, accessed by clicking a "Create a contact" menu link
    - The form should create a contact with a first and last name, as well as a street and city
    - When submitted, the contact data should be sent to an API that saves it
    - The user should then be automatically navigated back to the contact list
